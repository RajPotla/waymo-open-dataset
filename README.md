# Waymo Open Dataset

The Waymo Open Dataset is a collection of datasets and evaluation code that we
have released publicly to aid the research community in making advancements in
machine perception and autonomous driving technology.

The Waymo Open Dataset includes three datasets:

- The Perception dataset, with high resolution sensor data and labels for various tasks.
- The Motion dataset, with object trajectories and corresponding 3D maps for 103,354 scenes.
- The End-To-End Driving dataset, with camera data and high-level commands.

In this codebase, we provide evaluation code to support several tasks based on
these three dataset.

See [release history](src/waymo_open_dataset/LOG.md)
for a detailed list of changes.
